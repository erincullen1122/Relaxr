# Relaxr

Clearly I need more practice, but here's what I have so far. :) 

I have two versions: 

1) index.html (my main htm file) that includes wider margins + css.style
2) index2.html (not used as main file, but there to show 100% width on the box frames) + css2.style

I also included, in the most recent index.html update this css command to show all boxes on site to help me clean up the html/css a bit. 
Still working on it but that helped.

   border: 1px solid red !important;
}
